# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
   R squared is a value between zero and one where it tells you how well the model's predictions have matched with the data. What the R squared value does to a linear regression model is really tell you how accurate your model's predictions are to the actual data. So, when R squared is closer to one, it means that the model's predictions are pretty accurate, whereas if it's closer to zero, it would mean that the model isn't very accurate with its predictions. 

3. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
   137.6

5. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
 I think going based on age is pretty vague, meaning it's not enough data for the model to accurately predict someone's blood pressure only based on their age. In the future, maybe adding more data for the model to work around it could improve its predictions.
