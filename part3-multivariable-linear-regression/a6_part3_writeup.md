# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
   The R squared coefficient of my model is 0.86. It could mean that it's pretty accurate

3. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
I think it is because some of the values appear to be near the real value. 
4. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

5. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
   I think what happened was that it contains low ages and low mileages which probably caused the model to not be able to fit those.
